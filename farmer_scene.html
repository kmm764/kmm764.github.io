                                        <h2><strong>Scene Description</strong></h2>
                                        The night scene is based in a rural area. There farmers have to wake up early in the
                                        morning, before sunrise, in order to prepare for sowing. The scene is decorated with a bright
                                        moon, a fully textured house, a animated windmill, animated lamp, animated farmers and
                                        covered with a skybox. The farmers are using the hoe, forcing it onto the ground constantly
                                        to prepare the land for sowing.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>3D Modelling</strong><br />
                                        All of the 3D models in the scene are made by using C++, Most objects are made from
                                        cubes, from combining different cubes together. The house is the first 3D object i made in
                                        this project. First building the base, then proceed onto the triangles above the base, then
                                        roofs. After that I added doors, windows and lamp to the house. I learnt a lot from building
                                        the house, from drawing planars, to applying texture.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Hierarchical Modelling</strong><br />
                                        There are three objects in the scene that uses hierarchical modelling. The Human farmer,
                                        the lamp and the windmill. Each of these modules are made from cubes, Where the cubes
                                        rotates around the edge of the cube as a joint. For the Human farmer, his body consist of
                                        different human parts, the upper and lower arms, the body, the head, and the upper and
                                        lower legs, with ten parts in total. For the windmill, two cubes are used for the main body,
                                        where the windshaft and the four blades are connected, where they can be rotated in
                                        different directions. The lamp only consist of two parts, it might not fall into the category of
                                        hierarchical modelling with only two parts, but the bottom part of the lamp is rotating based
                                        on the bottom of the first part.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Animation</strong><br />
                                        All of the objects I mentioned in
                                        hierarchical modelling can be animated,
                                        where animations are designed special
                                        for the model’s movement. In the farmer
                                        model, all of the farmers have
                                        the same animation, where they swing
                                        the hoe with their right hand, combined
                                        with the body movement. The body
                                        movement as a whole is a loop. Where
                                        the loop is made from using both
                                        deltatime and sine. Sine makes sure that
                                        the body is moving back and forth instead
                                        of in 360 degrees rotation. The farmer’s movement animation starting position is unique, to
                                        not make the scene look too unrealistic, making sure they are not swing the hoe at the same
                                        time.<br /><br />
                                        For the lamp , it is consist of two parts, the
                                        chain and the lamp. The chain and the lamp are
                                        swinging back and forth constantly, with the lamp
                                        swinging based on the bottom of the chain, and the
                                        chain swings from the house’s roof.<br /><br />
                                        For the windmill, all the blades and the windshaft is
                                        rotating together in 360 degrees constanly. They are
                                        all rotating based on the base of the windshaft. I
                                        added an option for the user to speed the rotation up,
                                        or make it stop. When holding the “u” button on the
                                        Mac, the blades will stop rotating at the spot, without
                                        reseting to the original position. When holding the “y”
                                        button down, the blades and the windshaft will rotate
                                        at three times
                                        the normal
                                        speed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        <strong>Lighting</strong><br />
                                        For lightening, I used two light which is facing the
                                        ground of the scene. The first light source is from the
                                        moon, where the light source is placed next to the
                                        moon, projecting dim light onto the ground. I added
                                        more blue color into this light source to make it more
                                        realistic, closer to real moon light. For the moon itself, I made a glow effect on the moon,
                                        alongside with the walls of the skybox, to make the moon and stars glow in the dark as
                                        shown as the picture above. I place another light source next to it, with ambient set to 0.8f,
                                        while the global ambient is 0.01.f.<br /><br />
                                        The other light source is the lamp which is
                                        hanging from the house’s roof. The same as
                                        the moon, the lamp is glowing with full
                                        brightness comparing to the objects around
                                        it. The lamp is an object with animation. As
                                        the lamp swings, the light source swings
                                        along with the lamp. As shown on the image
                                        on the right, as the lamp swings towards the
                                        left, light are projected further on the left,
                                        and the window has noticeably got less light
                                        on the right hand side.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        <strong>Texture</strong><br />
                                        I textured all of my objects except the
                                        human farmer’s body. When I was texturing
                                        the objects, I overcame some difficulties, such as wrong rotation of the texture applied, or
                                        wrong size. I managed to fix it as I make changes to glTexCoord2f, and as I include more
                                        objects into the scene, I keep on replacing the old ugly texture with the new, better ones.
                                        The moon’s texture for example, is taken from the nasa website. I replaced the old ugly
                                        moon with this texture, which is a photo taken during the apollo mission. For most of my
                                        objects, I applied seamless texture to it, so that the textures can be placed side by side
                                        without creating a noticeable boundary between the two.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        <strong>Environment</strong><br />
                                        The environment theme is
                                        acheived by using a skybox,
                                        dim blue lights from the
                                        moon, and the lights from
                                        torches. As I am creating a
                                        night scene, the theme of the
                                        scene must be dark. I
                                        choose stars in the dark as
                                        the texture for my skybox,
                                        where the skybox is facing
                                        inwards. The ground of the
                                        floor is created with a
                                        Tessellation technique. With
                                        the floor made up by small
                                        quads, it can show proper light effects. In openGL, light is detected at the corners of the quad, therefor tessellation is needed for the lights to work on the floor. The walls of the
                                        skybox is at ambient (1.0f,1.0f,1.0f), except the ground, where I make sure that the stars are
                                        shining brightly, to create a better night atmosphere.

                                        <strong>User Control</strong><br />
                                        Basic user controls are already implemented in the framework (WASD, and mouse). There
                                        are a few additions added to the project. First, ‘m’ is added to increase the camera
                                        movement by three times when holded. Secondly, ‘e’ and ‘c’ is added to move the camera
                                        up and down. Thirdly, reset location is changed to a location with a better starting view.
                                        Fourthly, ‘q’ is added to reset to another position, viewing the scene in a different angle.
                                    </p>
