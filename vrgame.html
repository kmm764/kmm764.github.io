                                        <strong>Inspiration</strong><br />
                                        Some really cool VR game I have seen before such as "Creed: Rise to Glory", where the entire game is to immerse the player in a boxing match, which allows the player to train in a Virtual Reality enviornment. Which inspired me to develop a Virtual reality game that based on training the reflex aspect of Boxing, where "Creed: Rise to Glory" is lacking. I hoped to create a safe enviornment for Boxing/MMA practitioners to train their reflexs in a immersive sparring enviornment without the risk of injury.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>What it does</strong><br />
                                        There are three mini-games in total, with all of them with an aim to help the play improve their reflexs in a Virtual reality environment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>How I built it</strong><br />
                                        All three games are developed with Unity using Oculus SDK, designed for Oculus Quest.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Challenges I ran into</strong><br />
                                        It turns out that physics is one of the hardest element to impletement in all three VR games, especially when it comes to collision of different objects. Other than physics, animation of the bot throwing punches was also pretty tough to impletement, with the aim of making the punch as realistic as possible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        <strong>Accomplishments that I am proud of</strong><br />
                                        Produced a 18500-word report detailing the approach and results of the project, achieving Distinction in my MSc Computer Science course as a result.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Mini-Game 1</h2>

                                        After the game started, balls will start spawning in front of the player, with some distance between the ball and the player, but reachable for the player. Balls will spawn in a round arc shape area, making sure each ball will spawn at the same distance from the player. The player will then need to punch the ball as soon as it spawns, reaction time will be the time between the ball spawns and the time it takes for the player to hit the ball. There will be five balls in total spawning in a single round.
                                    </p>

                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/VR002.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>There will be a punching bag in front of the player, with four coloured panels on the punching bag, in four different positions. The positions will be places as a target location for four different punches, jab, cross, right hook and left hook. </p>
                                    <p>After the game starts,  indicators will change the background in one of the four colours, pink, white, green or yellow. When the background colour changes in the indicated colour, the player should hit the matching coloured buttons on the punching bag as hard as possible. </p>
                                    <hr class="major" />

                                    <h2>Mini-Game 3</h2>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/VR003.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>
                                        After the game starts, the AI opponent will start punching the player, including jab, cross, right hook and left hook. Player should react to dodge punches accordingly. There will be ten punches per round. Speed of the punches will increase each successful round, and the game will not end unless you fail a round. If the player gets hit more than four times in a single round, the game will be over. The speed of the failed round will determine the player’s speed limit.
                                    </p>
