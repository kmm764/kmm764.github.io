                                    <h2>University of Nottingham Mixed Martial Art Society</h2>
                                    <p><strong>Treasurer (2016-17), President (2017-18)</strong></p>
                                    <p>I have a keen interest in Mixed Martial Arts. I was elected as President and also Treasurer of the Mixed Martial Art society during my time at university. </p>
                                    <!--<p>During this period I organised a number of successful events and improved the finance status of the club, developed my communication, orgaisation and leaderships skills.</p>-->
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        As the treasurer, my duty included financial planning, budgeting, financial reporting, book-keeping and sales. These experiences have given me key organzation skills for personal development. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The next year I was elected as President; thus, increasing my leadership responsibilities to arrange committee meetings, task delegation, practice and events organisation, contract negotiation with external coach and communication with University staff and kit provider. These experiences have provided continuous training and experience in handling various situations, including managing crises, as well as acknowledging the importance of professionalism when under pressure.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Music qualifications</h2>
                                    <p>Trombone - Grade 8 <br />Piano - Grade 6<br /> Music Theory - Grade 5 </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I have keen interest in music instruments since the age of 6. I had been a member of the school orchestra since year 9 as a trombone player, performed in the Royal Festival Hall as part of the Reed's school celebration of the 200th anniversary of their foundation.
                                     
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Music qualifications show long term dedication and ability to learning a technical skill, which is required in this ever-changing industry.
                                    </p>
